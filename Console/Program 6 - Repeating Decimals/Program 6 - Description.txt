The Problem

Repeating numbers are real numbers which have sequences of digits that repeat forever. We show that by a horizontal bar over the repeating part.  

      ___
496.36279   is   496.36279279279279279 . . .

Although these numbers can never be written as a finite decimal value, they can be written as the quotient of two integers.

You will have an input file in which each line contains a real number and an integer; representing, respectively, the repeating decimal number and the quantity of digits that are repeated. Your task is to write a program that determines the numerator and denominator of the fraction that is equivalent to the repeating decimal number.

Input

A disk file containing one or more records. Each record will consist of two numeric values:

a floating-point value that will be the repeating decimal, and
an integer value that will be the number of digits that are repeated.
Output

For each input record, you should display the floating-point number as 1) a repeating decimal (a bar over the repeating part), 2) the numerator of the equivalent fraction, and 3) the denominator of the equivalent fraction.

Your output should include column headings and the data in the output list should bve aligned in columns.

Example (This sample data provided so you can test your program.)

The test data file is:

7.45656 2
0.00345345 3
13.00279 4

The output that should be produced by the test data is:

 Number     Numerator  Denominator
      __
 7.45646         7382          990
        ___
 0.00345345       345        99900
    ____
13.00279      1300149        99990
