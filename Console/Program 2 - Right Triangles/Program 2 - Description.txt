The Problem

Read an integer from the keyboard, then use the random number function to create an array of numbers. Calculate the values required for the output.

Input

A single positive integer entered from the keyboard to designate the quantity of numbers to put in the array.

Output

the numbers in the array,
the mean,
the maximum and it index in the array, and
the minumum and it index in the array.
Example (This sample data provided so you can test your program.)

If the input number is:

6

The output might be:

The array = {2, 5, 3, 1, 6, 4}
Mean = 3.5
Max = 6 (index 4)
Min = 1 (index 3)

Note: the actual output will depend on which numbers are generated during execution.
