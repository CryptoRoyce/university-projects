The Problem

Consider the standard quadratic equation form, y = Ax2 + Bx + C.

Given the values of A, B, C, and x; find and print the coordinates of the point on the curve of the equation at x.

Input

Data will be entered from the keyboard in sets of four numbers corresponding to A, B, C, and x.
All input will be real numbers (not integers).
Entry will end when all four numbers are 0.0.
Output

Your output must be printed in standard ordered pair notation, i.e., (x, y).
Print at least one decimal place; e.g., for 43.2543 you could print 43.3, 43.25, or 43.254, etc.; for 18.0 you could print 18.0 or 18.00, etc.
Do not print in scientific notation.
Example (This sample data provided so you can test your program.)

If the data is:

3.6 5.2 -7.1 4.9
0.0 -2.1 34.9 0.0
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

The output might be:

(4.9, 104.8)
(0.0, 34.9)
