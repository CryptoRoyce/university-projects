The Problem

Your computer store is having a sale. Your task is to design and write a program that reads customer orders from a disk file, calculates the total cost of the purchase, and writes invoice records to a second disk file.

Items and the sale prices:

 	Computer, laptop	 	$525.00
Computer, desktop	$600.00
Printer, laser	$350.00
Printer, ink jet	$175.00
Monitor, LCD	$150.00
Dual monitor package
     (second monitor and circuit card)	$200.00
Docking station	$75.00
Constraints:

You may not sell a docking station unless the customer buys a laptop.
To purchase the dual monitor package, the customer must first purchase a monitor.
A 5% discount will be given if customer purchases either of two packages:
desktop, monitor, and printer, or
a laptop and a printer.
Input

There will be one input record for each customer

Each record will consist of eight fields separated by commas. The first field will be the customer's name, the remaining fields will be integers corresponding to the quantity of each item purchased (laptop, desktop, laser printer, ink jet printer, monitor, dual monitor, docking station).

Output

Output will be written to a disk file named YourName.7.txt. Replace YourName with your last name.
For each customer, an invoice formatted as shown below in the sample output and will include:
The customer's name, left justified
The four column headings in two lines using the spacing shown in the sample output
One line for each item purchased showing appropriate data in each column. Columns will be aligned as shown in the sample output
The amount of the discount, 0 if none, aligned as shown in the sample output.
A subtotal of the purchase price, aligned as shown in the sample output.
The amount of sales tax calculated at 3.5%, aligned as shown in the sample output.
The total cost of the purchase, aligned as shown in the sample output.
Any exception to the inventory items, separated from the invoice details by a blank line.
A line of thirty (30) dashes will be written at the end of each invoice.
Example (This sample data is provided so you can test your program.)

If the data is:

John Doe,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Susan Smith,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
Francais Stevens,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
Jack Johnson,0,2,1,0,2,1,0

The output should be:
